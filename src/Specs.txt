Defs:
User = Dev
Client = Software User

This class will allow the user to create a menu in the CLI by creating an instance of the class.

The user can:
1. Create a numbered list of lines with customisable numbers 

2. Have that list start (start as in including that number, inclusive) from any number and increase by any step.
E.g. a list starting at zero w/ 5 items w/ step of 2 = 0, 2, 4, 6, 8

3. Have custom line prefixes. (The [1] or 1) 1. at the start of each line)

4. Have custom characters instead of just letters in the line selector character (maybe)


Notes
pass an array for the lines of options (and for customiabvle characters?)

key array, value array
key array generator
arrays into hash map

Presets:
Have them in a file/seperate files (like the most but file reading is an arse but is the most scalable/easy to add new presets)
have them in a class that has methods that then calls the CLIMenu constructors with the needed params (Like, seems the easiest and pretty efficient)
hav lots of different classes that extend CLIMenu with the needed variable (dislike the most)
